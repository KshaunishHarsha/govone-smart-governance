GovOne: Unified E-Governance Platform for India
GovOne is a digital platform that streamlines Indian government services, integrating citizen complaints, service appointments, document requests, and bill payments into a single, user-friendly interface. Built for the Ace2.0 Hackathon, this MVP leverages AI-driven alerts, a Crowdsourced Problem Map with location-based upvotes, and a DigiLocker-like login to enhance accessibility for India’s 1.4 billion citizens.
