# GovOne: Unified E-Governance Platform for India

**GovOne** is a one-stop digital platform that simplifies access to Indian government services. It brings together **citizen complaints, service appointments, document requests, and bill payments** into a single user-friendly interface.

Built as an **MVP for the Ace2.0 Hackathon**, GovOne integrates **AI-driven alerts, a crowdsourced problem map, and DigiLocker-style authentication** to improve transparency, accessibility, and efficiency for India’s 1.4 billion citizens.
